# Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I worked through The Odin Project up until the JavaScript section, which involved setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Visual Studio Code integration. I also did some research on hosting providers, specifically those that offer free trials, credits, etc. I referred to Bootstrap’s official documentation when working on Practical 1.

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 6 hours working though The Odin Project and researching WSL and hosting providers.

## Content Insights

The Odin Project had great explanations on the foundational concepts, especially on the basics of flexbox. I also learnt Bootstrap 4 utilises flexbox while reading the documentation.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

While building the static website, I chose to look at the components in the Bootstrap examples, and then follow the documentation where I could to build what I wanted. I felt this was a good approach for me as it gave me an opportunity to explore multiple concepts as opposed to just one example. I’m used to reading documentation at work in situations where there is little other information, so I feel that this helped me.
