## Estimated Hours

Approximately 2-3 hours reading articles and experimenting with various local development options.

## Content Insights

I haven’t used Docker before, but I liked the ability to quickly spin up containers, and the ability to customise them with Docker Compose and Dockerfile files, so you can always start from the same configuration.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I think automation in general is an important concept to have some knowledge on. I work for a fairly large organisation and a lot of our repeatable processes are automated, where they can be. Processes such as provisioning servers, creating user accounts, deploying software updates, etc. If a common process is not automated, there’s always discussion on ways to automate it and what roadblocks there can be.
