## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Outside of work, I have a recognised problem with time management. I discussed with my supervisor and organised study hours during work time. I am also in the process of planning my annual leave over the coming weeks to commit more time to the subject. This is something I need to improve on as it could very easily affect my work life.
