## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 5 hours working though the LinkedIn Learning course and on various Joomla resources while completing the practical.

## Content Insights

To me it felt like there was a big difference between the user-friendliness of Joomla and WordPress. WordPress seemed simpler, while Joomla seemed a lot more involved. As an example, while looking for solutions to customise certain aspects of the navigation bar, a lot of the solutions involved overriding the CSS, while you can complete the same actions in WordPress with the GUI editor.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Working with both Joomla and WordPress this week highlighted to me that even though you may be working with a CMS and repurposing an existing theme, you still need adequate knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to adequately troubleshoot and perform further customisations. This is an area I will need to improve on over the coming weeks.
